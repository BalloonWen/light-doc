There are so many tools that help us to build APIs/services regardless they are
monolithic applications or microservices and here is a small list.

* [Hugo](https://networknt.github.io/tool/hugo/) is used to create the document site for networknt.github.io and all our document sites for each repository.

* [Memory Monitoring](https://networknt.github.io/light-4j/tools/memory_monitor/) on MacOS while doing performance test

* [WRK](https://networknt.github.io/light-4j/tools/wrk-perf/) is used as client for performance test.

* [Minikube](https://networknt.github.io/light-4j/tools/minikube/) is a single node Kubernetes cluster for developers to work on laptop.
