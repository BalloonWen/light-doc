title: Registry
---

This module contains all the interfaces that are needed in registry and
discovery. Also it implemented Direct registry which you can hard-code
services into the service.yml in order to simulate consul or zookeeper
during development.

Currently, Consul and ZooKeeper are supported for external service registry
and discovery.
