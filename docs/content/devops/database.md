As part of our infrastructure, we are supporting two databases: one SQL and one No-SQL.
For customer who have their databases already, they should be easily supported. 


* [Mysql](https://networknt.github.io/light-4j/devops/mysql/) - An open source relational database.
* [ArangoDB](https://networknt.github.io/light-4j/devops/arango/) - An open source multiple model database with Document, Graph and KV support.
