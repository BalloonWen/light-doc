light-4j and all the related light-*-4j frameworks are some of the fastest frameworks to
build microservices on the market in different styles. There are several examples that
show developers how to implement high performance microservices.

## One example can be found at our own microservices benchmark repo which is just test
the raw throughput and latency of the framework.

You can find the source code at https://github.com/networknt/microservices-framework-benchmark/tree/master/light-java/a


## We also submitted full suite of test cases to Tech Empower to compare with other web
frameworks and the source code can be found at https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/tree/master/frameworks/Java/light-java
