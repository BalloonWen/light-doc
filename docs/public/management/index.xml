      <description>Development Flow There are three flows running in parallel but not started at the same time in API development
API Specification starts the first and it will be done by data architect and business analyst.
API implementation starts when the first release of the specification is done by API developers.
Client implementations start almost the same time as API implementation team for mock API can be generated from swagger specification immediately.</description>
