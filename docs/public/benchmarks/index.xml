      <description>Light-4J framework is one of the fastest API frameworks on the market and there are a lot of effort to make that happen. There are a lot of frameworks, languages to build microservices but most popular ones are Java, Go and Nodejs.
Nodejs used to be really fast compare with Java EE platforms but it has a lot of issues in enterprise world. Go has potentials but is still not mature in enterprise applications.</description>

 Nodejs is faster than Java at runtime. Nodejs development is more productive than Java.  These claims are proved to be false already as I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on both platforms in banking industry for the last couple of years. I have been building REST API frameworks on both Java and Nodejs and the following are my observations on Nodejs in enterprise computing.</description>
