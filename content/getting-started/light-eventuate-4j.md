When building services with light platform, you can use request/response approach
like [rest][], [graphql][] or [hybrid][]. The interaction with the services are 
synchronous. This requires all involved services to be responsive and highly available. 
There is another way to handler interaction between services - asynchronous event driven.
light-eventuate-4j is not only event driven framework, it supports Event Sourcing and
CQRS to ensure data consistency between services.
