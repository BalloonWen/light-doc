[GraphQL][] is a new style of protocol open sourced by Facebook and it is getting popular
especially in Mobile and Single Page Application as front end. GraphQL provides a complete 
and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for 
exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and 
enables powerful developer tools.
