Light-rest-4j is a framework that is designed to speed up RESTful API development and 
deployment. On top of light-4j, it has several middleware handlers specifically designed 
around OpenAPI specification. With the specification ready, you can scaffold project
with [light-codegen][] and the specification will be loaded during the runtime to to
enable JWT scope verification and schema validation for the request.
