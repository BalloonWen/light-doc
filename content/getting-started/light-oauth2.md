The nature of the services is easy access so security is the most important thing when
deploying services. Light platform is a security first design and an OAuth 2.0 service
provider is available as part of the ecosystem. Along with light-portal client registration
and service registration, light-oauth2 provides more than normal OAuth 2.0 for microservices
such as public key distribution, scope management and distributed policy management.
