This release [1.5.1](https://github.com/networknt/light-proxy/releases/tag/1.5.1) adds several enhancements.

* [Add HeaderHandler into the middleware chain][] - Add HeaderHandler into the middleware config file to
manipulate reqeust/response headers.   

* [Enable TSL connection to downstream services][] - If the downstream service(s) are not deployed on the
same VM as light-proxy, the connection between light-proxy and downstream services should be TLS. This
requires some special configuration change on the light-proxy config.
