Basic request validation for the graphql path and methods. It is the first line of validation right after graphql-security and it doesnâ€™t have any knowledge about the graphql query parameter and body. Other schema based validation will be done at GraphQL level.

It shares the same configuration file with swagger-validator and here is an example.

```
# Validate request/response for GraphQL request
---
enabled: true
enableResponseValidator: false
```
