As light-rest-4j is the first framework supported, we have more Restful examples than any other 
style of microserivces. All rest examples can be found at [light-example-4j][]. Under rest folder
there are two folders to differentiate Swagger 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.0 implementations. 

Most example applications consist multiple services and only petstore is a single service
which is described in [getting started][]. 

The rest of examples are used in [tutorial][] and you can follow them step by step into the details.
