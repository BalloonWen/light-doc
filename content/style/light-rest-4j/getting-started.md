To start a microservice with light-rest-4j, the easier way is to use [light-codegen][]
to scaffold a running application based on your Swagger 2.0 specification or OpenAPI 3.0 
specification and a config.json that controls how code generator works.

The other way to start your project if you don't want to follow design driven approach is 
to copy one of our [examples][] and extend it based on your use cases.

For details on [getting started with light-rest-4j][], please refer to that section.
