Most of our developers are using IntelliJ Idea as the IDE when working on light-platform or building application on the light platform. Its community edition is free and has all the features we need.

### Settings

There are several personal settings that might be useful for others to increase productivity. 

##### Change font size

I am using a 40 inch 4K monitor and have more screen real estate. It would be much easier to increase the font size when needed. To do that, got to File/Settings/Editor/General. In the Mouse section, check the "Change font size(Zoom) with Ctrl+Mouse Wheel"
