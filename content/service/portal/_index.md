A service for consumer and provider runtime management and marketplace to bridge between consumers 
and providers. When you build microservices in large scale on top of light-4j and related frameworks,
you need a service to manage the entire life-cycle of your services and provide a market place for
bridging API consumers and API providers. We have explore the open sources projects on github.com
and could not find any existing product that meets our requirement, so we decide to build it on top
of light-4j framework.
