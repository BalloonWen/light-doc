There are a lot of options to deploy services built on top of light frameworks. You can
deploy them as a jar file and run with java -jar on data center physical machines or VMs.
You an also package services into docker images and deploy them to the cloud environment
with Kubernetes. In addition, you can host your services in our cloud at lightapi.net.
