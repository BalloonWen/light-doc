For people who are not developers but understand the platform, you are encouraged to write your knowledge and experience for the platform. We have a brand new tab called `blog` is reserved and your blogs can be published on our site www.networknt.com

There is no limitation on what topics you can write and we will publish anything related to the platform. Also, you can publish the blog to other websites as you wish. 

When you are unsure if the content you are writing is 100% accurate, you can send the article to us for review before publishing. 

As a brand new platform, we are changing the landscape of Java enterprise development without using Jakarta EE. It is a paradigm shift and we need the community to spread the knowledge and promote the platform. With all of us working together, we can build a successful platform that can be beneficial for all of us.
