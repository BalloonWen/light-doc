For most developers working with applications built on top of the light platform, it is easier to contribute examples than to enhance the platform. We have a repository [light-example-4j][] that contains all sorts of examples for other developers to learn how to use the platform. If you have some good ideas or you happen to create an application that is unique, please consider contributing to the light-example-4j repository to help others. If you are interested, you can also write a tutorial to show people how your example works. 

The guideline for contributing example project is very similar to [development][]. The only difference is that we have so many examples located in one repository and you need to find the best location for your example. 

To start working with the light-example-4j repository, please fork it and clone the forked repo to your local. For the rest of the steps, please refer to [development][].
