Light Platform relies heavily on the enthusiasm and participation of the open-source 
community. We need your support in its development, documentation, examples and
tutorials. In addition to above activities, opening issues on github.com and ask questions
on gitter rooms will help the team to improve the product and help other members to learn
how to use the platform. 

Light's contribution guidelines are [detailed in a `CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the light-4j source repository on GitHub.
