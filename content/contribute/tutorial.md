The light platform is aiming enterprise-scale microservices, and there are too many moving parts. The general feedback from our users is that it is hard to learn especially for Java EE developers. Even there are a lot of examples in [light-example-4j][] repository and we have so many infrastructure services built on the platform like [light-oauth2][], [light-portal][], [light-proxy][] and [light-rotuer][], a lot of beginners still don't know where to get started. 

To help our users, we have written tutorials that cover almost every perspective of the platform. These tutorials can be found at [document site][] and the repository is [light-doc][].

If you are contributing examples in light-example-4j, instead of writing a README.md to introduce your project, it is highly recommended that you write a tutorial for your project. In the process, you will learn more as you have to rethink all the details. For other people who are good writers, we need your help to write tutorials based on examples or write blogs about your experiences in using the platform.
