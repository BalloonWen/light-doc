In the previous step, we've generated a project into light-example-4j/rest/swagger/petstore folder
and it is ready to be built and started. 


To build and start the generated server, use the following command line.

```
cd ~/networknt/light-example-4j/rest/swagger/petstore
mvn install exec:exec
```

Now the server is started and listens to port 8443 on https.
