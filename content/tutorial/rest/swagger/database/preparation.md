In order to follow the steps below, please make sure you have the same working 
environment.

* A computer with MacOS or Linux (Windows should work but I never tried)
* Install git
* Install Docker
* Install JDK 8 and Maven
* Install Java IDE (Intellij IDEA Community Edition is recommended and it is free)
* Create a working directory under your user directory called networknt.

```
cd ~
mkdir networknt
```
