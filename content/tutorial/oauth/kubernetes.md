In the [start services][] section, we have introduced docker-comopse commands to start the light-oauth2 services with different databases. It is good for dev and test environment but not production. For production deployment, we are going to use Kubernetes or other Kubernetes implementations. In this tutorial, we are going to walk through the deployment on a three nodes Kubernetes cluster.
