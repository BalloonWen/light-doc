This is the tutorial to learn how to run the light-bot for networknt projects and how
to leverage it for your own organizations and repositories. As it is using config module
from light-4j, the config files can be externalized to somewhere in the host filesystem.
You can deploy it in one of your devops VMs and set it up run automatically for develop build
and test. Other tasks will be triggered manually and only be used occasionally.


* Set up [develop][] branch build and test on your computer
