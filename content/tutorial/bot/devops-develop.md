In this tutorial, we are going to setup an automatic build process on our devops VM running
in a data center.

### Connection

First let's follow the [ssh] tool tutorial to upload public key to the devops server so that
we don't need to type password every time we want to log into the server.

### Environment

We need to ensure that the following software packages are installed on the server.

* Docker
* JDK
* [Maven][]
* Git

### 

[ssh]: /tool/ssh/
[Maven]: /tool/maven/
