Light platform is following security first design as most of our customers are big financial companies
and they need to ensure confidentiality, availability and integrity first then scale the system to lower
the production cost and development cost. 

When the platform was designed, we focused a lot efforts on the security details and make a lot of
default configuration so that our customers won't need to do a lot of extra things to bring up a
system securely. Once they feel comfortable, they can start configure their services based on their
business requirement or non-functional requirement. 

In this section, we have several tutorials related to security configurations and implementations.
