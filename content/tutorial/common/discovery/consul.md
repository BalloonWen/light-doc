title: Consul service registry and discovery
---

Previous step [multiple][] demonstrates how to use direct registry to enable load balance and
it works the same way as Consul and Zookeeper registry. In this step, we are going to
use Consul for registry to enable cluster.

Now let's copy from multiple to consul for each API.
 

```
cd ~/networknt/light-example-4j/discovery/api_a
cp -r multiple consul
cd ~/networknt/light-example-4j/discovery/api_b
cp -r multiple consul
cd ~/networknt/light-example-4j/discovery/api_c
cp -r multiple consul
cd ~/networknt/light-example-4j/discovery/api_d
cp -r multiple consul
```


### API A

In order to switch from direct registry to consul registry, we just need to update
service.yml configuration to inject the consul implementation to the registry interface.

service.yml

```yaml
# Singleton service factory configuration/IoC injection
singletons:
- com.networknt.registry.URL:
  - com.networknt.registry.URLImpl:
      protocol: light
      host: localhost
      port: 8080
      path: consul
      parameters:
        registryRetryPeriod: '30000'
- com.networknt.consul.client.ConsulClient:
  - com.networknt.consul.client.ConsulClientImpl:
    - java.lang.String: http
    - java.lang.String: localhost
    - int: 8500
- com.networknt.registry.Registry:
  - com.networknt.consul.ConsulRegistry
- com.networknt.balance.LoadBalance:
  - com.networknt.balance.RoundRobinLoadBalance
- com.networknt.cluster.Cluster:
  - com.networknt.cluster.LightCluster
# HandlerProvider implementation
- com.networknt.server.HandlerProvider:
  - com.networknt.apia.PathHandlerProvider
# StartupHookProvider implementations, there are one to many and they are called in the same sequence defined.
# - com.networknt.server.StartupHookProvider:
  # - com.networknt.server.Test1StartupHook
  # - com.networknt.server.Test2StartupHook
# ShutdownHookProvider implementations, there are one to many and they are called in the same sequence defined.
# - com.networknt.server.ShutdownHookProvider:
  # - com.networknt.server.Test1ShutdownHook
# MiddlewareHandler implementations, the calling sequence is as defined in the request/response chain.
- com.networknt.handler.MiddlewareHandler:
  # Exception Global exception handler that needs to be called first to wrap all middleware handlers and business handlers
  - com.networknt.exception.ExceptionHandler
  # Metrics handler to calculate response time accurately, this needs to be the second handler in the chain.
  - com.networknt.metrics.MetricsHandler
  # Traceability Put traceabilityId into response header from request header if it exists
  - com.networknt.traceability.TraceabilityHandler
  # Correlation Create correlationId if it doesn't exist in the request header and put it into the request header
  - com.networknt.correlation.CorrelationHandler
  # Swagger Parsing swagger specification based on request uri and method.
  - com.networknt.swagger.SwaggerHandler
  # Security JWT token verification and scope verification (depending on SwaggerHandler)
  - com.networknt.security.JwtVerifyHandler
  # Body Parse body based on content type in the header.
  - com.networknt.body.BodyHandler
  # SimpleAudit Log important info about the request into audit log
  - com.networknt.audit.AuditHandler
  # Sanitizer Encode cross site scripting
  - com.networknt.sanitizer.SanitizerHandler
  # Validator Validate request based on swagger specification (depending on Swagger and Body)
  - com.networknt.validator.ValidatorHandler
```

Although in our case, there is no caller service for API A, we still need to register
it to consul by enable it in server.yml. Note that enableRegsitry is turn on and enableHttp
is turned off. 

If you don't turn off the http port, both ports will be registered on Consul. 

```yaml

# Server configuration
---
# This is the default binding address if the service is dockerized.
ip: 0.0.0.0

# Http port if enableHttp is true.
httpPort:  7001

# Enable HTTP should be false on official environment.
enableHttp: false

# Https port if enableHttps is true.
httpsPort:  7441

# Enable HTTPS should be true on official environment.
enableHttps: true

# Http/2 is enabled by default.
enableHttp2: true

# Keystore file name in config folder. KeystorePass is in secret.yml to access it.
keystoreName: tls/server.keystore

# Flag that indicate if two way TLS is enabled. Not recommended in docker container.
enableTwoWayTls: false

# Truststore file name in config folder. TruststorePass is in secret.yml to access it.
truststoreName: tls/server.truststore

# Unique service identifier. Used in service registration and discovery etc.
serviceId: com.networknt.apia-1.0.0

# Flag to enable service registration. Only be true if running as standalone Java jar.
enableRegistry: true

# environment tag that will be registered on consul to support multiple instances per env for testing.
# https://github.com/networknt/light-doc/blob/master/docs/content/design/env-segregation.md
# This tag should only be set for testing env, not production. The production certification process will enforce it.
# environment: test1
```


### API B

Let's update service.yml to inject consul registry instead of direct registry used in
the previous step.

service.yml

```yaml
# Singleton service factory configuration/IoC injection
singletons:
- com.networknt.registry.URL:
  - com.networknt.registry.URLImpl:
      protocol: light
      host: localhost
      port: 8080
      path: consul
      parameters:
        registryRetryPeriod: '30000'
- com.networknt.consul.client.ConsulClient:
  - com.networknt.consul.client.ConsulClientImpl:
    - java.lang.String: http
    - java.lang.String: localhost
    - int: 8500
- com.networknt.registry.Registry:
  - com.networknt.consul.ConsulRegistry
- com.networknt.balance.LoadBalance:
  - com.networknt.balance.RoundRobinLoadBalance
- com.networknt.cluster.Cluster:
  - com.networknt.cluster.LightCluster
# HandlerProvider implementation
- com.networknt.server.HandlerProvider:
  - com.networknt.apib.PathHandlerProvider
# StartupHookProvider implementations, there are one to many and they are called in the same sequence defined.
# - com.networknt.server.StartupHookProvider:
  # - com.networknt.server.Test1StartupHook
  # - com.networknt.server.Test2StartupHook
# ShutdownHookProvider implementations, there are one to many and they are called in the same sequence defined.
# - com.networknt.server.ShutdownHookProvider:
  # - com.networknt.server.Test1ShutdownHook
# MiddlewareHandler implementations, the calling sequence is as defined in the request/response chain.
- com.networknt.handler.MiddlewareHandler:
  # Exception Global exception handler that needs to be called first to wrap all middleware handlers and business handlers
  - com.networknt.exception.ExceptionHandler
  # Metrics handler to calculate response time accurately, this needs to be the second handler in the chain.
  - com.networknt.metrics.MetricsHandler
  # Traceability Put traceabilityId into response header from request header if it exists
  - com.networknt.traceability.TraceabilityHandler
  # Correlation Create correlationId if it doesn't exist in the request header and put it into the request header
  - com.networknt.correlation.CorrelationHandler
  # Swagger Parsing swagger specification based on request uri and method.
  - com.networknt.swagger.SwaggerHandler
  # Security JWT token verification and scope verification (depending on SwaggerHandler)
  - com.networknt.security.JwtVerifyHandler
  # Body Parse body based on content type in the header.
  - com.networknt.body.BodyHandler
  # SimpleAudit Log important info about the request into audit log
  - com.networknt.audit.AuditHandler
  # Sanitizer Encode cross site scripting
  - com.networknt.sanitizer.SanitizerHandler
  # Validator Validate request based on swagger specification (depending on Swagger and Body)
  - com.networknt.validator.ValidatorHandler

```

As API B will be called by API A, it needs to register itself to consul registry so
that API A can discover it through the same consul registry. To do that you only need
to enable server registry in config file and disable http connection.

server.yml

```yaml

# Server configuration
---
# This is the default binding address if the service is dockerized.
ip: 0.0.0.0

# Http port if enableHttp is true.
httpPort:  7002

# Enable HTTP should be false on official environment.
enableHttp: false

# Https port if enableHttps is true.
httpsPort:  7442

# Enable HTTPS should be true on official environment.
enableHttps: true

# Http/2 is enabled by default.
enableHttp2: true

# Keystore file name in config folder. KeystorePass is in secret.yml to access it.
keystoreName: tls/server.keystore

# Flag that indicate if two way TLS is enabled. Not recommended in docker container.
enableTwoWayTls: false

# Truststore file name in config folder. TruststorePass is in secret.yml to access it.
truststoreName: tls/server.truststore

# Unique service identifier. Used in service registration and discovery etc.
serviceId: com.networknt.apib-1.0.0

# Flag to enable service registration. Only be true if running as standalone Java jar.
enableRegistry: true

# environment tag that will be registered on consul to support multiple instances per env for testing.
# https://github.com/networknt/light-doc/blob/master/docs/content/design/env-segregation.md
# This tag should only be set for testing env, not production. The production certification process will enforce it.
# environment: test1
```

### API C

Although API C is not calling any other APIs, it needs to register itself to consul
so that API A can discovery it from the same consul registry. Let's create service.yml

service.yml

```yaml

```


### Start Consul

Here we are starting consul server in docker to serve as a centralized registry. To make it
simpler, the ACL in consul is disable by setting acl_default_policy=allow.

```
docker run -d -p 8400:8400 -p 8500:8500/tcp -p 8600:53/udp -e 'CONSUL_LOCAL_CONFIG={"acl_datacenter":"dc1","acl_default_policy":"allow","acl_down_policy":"extend-cache","acl_master_token":"the_one_ring","bootstrap_expect":1,"datacenter":"dc1","data_dir":"/usr/local/bin/consul.d/data","server":true}' consul agent -server -ui -bind=127.0.0.1 -client=0.0.0.0
```


### Start four servers

Now let's start four terminals to start servers.  

API A

```
cd ~/networknt/light-example-4j/discovery/api_a/consul
mvn clean install -DskipTests
mvn exec:exec
```

API B

```
cd ~/networknt/light-example-4j/discovery/api_b/consul
mvn clean install -DskipTests
mvn exec:exec

```

API C

```
cd ~/networknt/light-example-4j/discovery/api_c/consul
mvn clean install -DskipTests 
mvn exec:exec

```

API D


And start the first instance that listen to 7444 as default

```
cd ~/networknt/light-example-4j/discovery/api_d/consul
mvn clean install -DskipTests 
mvn exec:exec

```

If you follow the above sequence to start servers, then you will find that API A and 
API B show some error messages as they cannot establish connections to target servers. 

You can ignore these errors and as the connections will be recreated on the first request. 

Now you can see the registered service from Consul UI.

```
http://localhost:8500/ui
```


### Test four servers

```
curl -k https://localhost:7441/v1/data
```

And the result will be

```
["API D: Message 1 from port 7445","API D: Message 2 from port 7445","API B: Message 1","API B: Message 2","API C: Message 1","API C: Message 2","API A: Message 1","API A: Message 2"]
```
 
### Start another API D
 
Now let's start the second instance of API D. Before starting the serer, let's update
server.yml with port 7444.

```yaml


# Server configuration
---
# This is the default binding address if the service is dockerized.
ip: 0.0.0.0

# Http port if enableHttp is true.
httpPort:  7004

# Enable HTTP should be false on official environment.
enableHttp: false

# Https port if enableHttps is true.
httpsPort:  7444

# Enable HTTPS should be true on official environment.
enableHttps: true

# Http/2 is enabled by default.
enableHttp2: true

# Keystore file name in config folder. KeystorePass is in secret.yml to access it.
keystoreName: tls/server.keystore

# Flag that indicate if two way TLS is enabled. Not recommended in docker container.
enableTwoWayTls: false

# Truststore file name in config folder. TruststorePass is in secret.yml to access it.
truststoreName: tls/server.truststore

# Unique service identifier. Used in service registration and discovery etc.
serviceId: com.networknt.apid-1.0.0

# Flag to enable service registration. Only be true if running as standalone Java jar.
enableRegistry: true

# environment tag that will be registered on consul to support multiple instances per env for testing.
# https://github.com/networknt/light-doc/blob/master/docs/content/design/env-segregation.md
# This tag should only be set for testing env, not production. The production certification process will enforce it.
# environment: test1

```

And start the second instance

```
cd ~/networknt/light-example-4j/discovery/api_d/consul
mvn clean install -DskipTests 
mvn exec:exec

```

After you start the second instance of API D, you can go to the Web UI of consul to check if
there are two instances for the API D. 

### Test Servers

As we cache the connection in our application, so even there is a new server added to
consul, it won't be used unless we create a new connection for each request. 

Let's issue the same command again. 

```
curl -k https://localhost:7441/v1/data
```

And the result should be the same.

```
["API D: Message 1 from port 7445","API D: Message 2 from port 7445","API B: Message 1","API B: Message 2","API C: Message 1","API C: Message 2","API A: Message 1","API A: Message 2"]
```

Shutdown the server with port 7445. Now when you call the same curl command, you will 
see 7444 server picks up the request.  

```
["API C: Message 1","API C: Message 2","API D: Message 1 from port 7444","API D: Message 2 from port 7444","API B: Message 1","API B: Message 2","API A: Message 1","API A: Message 2"]
```

In step, we have Consul server started and each API register itself to the Consul. When we call
the API A, all other APIs were discovered from Consul to fulfill the request. In the next step,
we are going to start multiple instances that represent different environment with [tag][].
