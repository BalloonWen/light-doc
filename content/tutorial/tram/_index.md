Light-tram-4j is the foundation of event driven frameworks and it handles transactional
messaging without XA. On top of light-tram-4j, there is light-saga-4j to handle distributed 
transactions across multiple microservices. Also there is a framework light-eventuate-4j to
support Event Sourcing and CQRS architecture. All tutorials here are showing basic message,
event or command delivery from one service to another service.
